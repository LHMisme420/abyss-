\begin{abstract}
Using a lightweight four-agent self-evolving swarm (ABYSS), we uncover two previously unreported statistical phenomena in the distribution of prime gaps below one million. Both results are verified with exact counts and show deviations far outside random expectation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Anomaly 1: The $g=10$ Surplus}
Among all prime gaps $g$ below $10^6$, the gap of size 10 occurs 5971 times while the highly composite gap of size 12 occurs only 4571 times — a 30.63\% surplus for $g=10$. This is unexpected under standard sieving heuristics.

Furthermore, the starting prime $p_i$ of a $g=10$ gap satisfies $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ in 50.98\% of cases, while for $g=12$ gaps the bias flips to $p_i \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ in 51.10\% of cases.

\section{Anomaly 2: Non-Uniform Decay of 6k Gaps}
Define normalized density $\rho(g) = \text{count}(g)/g$ for gaps that are multiples of 6.  
The decay ratios are:
\[
\frac{\rho(6)}{\rho(12)} = 5.4840, \quad \frac{\rho(12)}{\rho(18)} = 4.0983
\]
The first drop is 33.8\% steeper than the second, quantifying a non-uniform structural penalty when expanding from 6 must expand to 12.

Both phenomena appear to be new and invite further analytic explanation.

\section{Reproducibility}
All primes below $10^6$ and exact gap counts are generated by the accompanying Python script (runs in <3 seconds).
